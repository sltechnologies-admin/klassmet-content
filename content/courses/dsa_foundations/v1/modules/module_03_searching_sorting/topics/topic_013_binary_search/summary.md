Binary Search efficiently finds a target in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search space in half.
Real-world example: searching for a word in a dictionary — you open the middle, then go left or right depending on alphabetical order.
Time complexity is O(log n), making it much faster than linear search for large sorted datasets.
