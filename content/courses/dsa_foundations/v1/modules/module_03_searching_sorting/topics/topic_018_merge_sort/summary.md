# Merge Sort

**Definition:** Divide array into halves, recursively sort each half, then merge sorted halves.

**Real-time Example:** Merging sorted exam results from multiple school classes into one ranked list.

## Complexity
| Case | Time | Space |
|------|------|-------|
| All cases | O(n log n) | O(n) |

## Key Advantages
- Guaranteed O(n log n) - no worst case degradation
- Stable sorting algorithm
- Best choice for linked lists (no random access needed)
