# Counting Sort

**Definition:** Sort by counting frequency of each distinct element, no comparisons needed.

**Real-time Example:** Counting votes in an election - count votes per candidate, then output in order.

## Complexity
| Case | Time | Space |
|------|------|-------|
| All cases | O(n+k) | O(k) |

k = range of input values

## Requirements
- Input must be non-negative integers
- Value range k must be reasonably small
