Bubble Sort repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order, causing larger elements to "bubble up" to their correct position.
Real-world example: like bubbles rising in water — the largest bubbles (elements) float to the top first.
It is a comparison-based sort with O(n²) worst-case time complexity, making it inefficient for large datasets.
