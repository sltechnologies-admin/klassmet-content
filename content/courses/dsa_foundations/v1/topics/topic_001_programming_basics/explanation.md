## What is Programming?

Programming is writing instructions for a computer to perform tasks or solve problems.

A program is a set of step-by-step instructions that a computer follows exactly as written.

### Real-time Example

Writing steps for an ATM to withdraw cash:

1. Insert card
2. Enter PIN
3. Select amount
4. Dispense cash
5. Eject card

Each step is precise and ordered — that is exactly what programming is. The ATM runs a program that follows these instructions every time.

### Key Points

- Programming is language-agnostic at its core — the *logic* matters more than the syntax.
- Common programming languages: Java, Python, C++, JavaScript.
- Programs are converted to machine code by a compiler or interpreter before the computer can run them.
