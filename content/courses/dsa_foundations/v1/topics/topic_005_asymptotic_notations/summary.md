Asymptotic notations are mathematical tools used to describe the growth rate of an algorithm's time or space complexity.

In this topic, you will learn the three main notations — Big-O, Omega, and Theta — and understand how to use them to compare algorithms efficiently, like comparing the fuel consumption of different vehicles.
